Reason for Developing a Personal Homepage
The reason I decided to develop a personal homepage was because, while learning web development, I felt the need to create a tangible result. Among the possible projects, I thought it would be beneficial to develop a personal homepage that contains information about myself and my career, providing visitors with a clear window into who I am.

Development Method
Since it was my first time developing a website, I realized it would take a long time and be challenging to use HTML and JavaScript, which I was not familiar with. Instead, I chose to use the Hugo library, which allowed me to develop the site with relatively little syntax, significantly reducing development time. Additionally, I used templates for the design, resulting in a higher-quality website than if I had developed it entirely from scratch.

Development Issues
When errors occurred, searching the internet mostly yielded results related to web development using HTML and JavaScript, making it difficult to find information specific to development using the Hugo library. This made obtaining the necessary information quite challenging.
