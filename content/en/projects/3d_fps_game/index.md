3D FPS Game Development
After developing a 2D game using the Unity engine, I developed an interest in creating a 3D game, so I referred to a book and proceeded with the development.

The development period was about 3 weeks. Although the scale of the game was larger than the 2D game, it wasn't large enough to be played by others extensively.

The reason it took 3 weeks to develop was that I did not focus solely on this project but developed it intermittently while doing other things.

Development Issues
Since it was a 3D game, there were more considerations compared to developing a 2D game, more errors occurred, and it took longer to fix them.
