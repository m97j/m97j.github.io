Before Development [Development Tools]
First, I will temporarily name this game "universe flight & fight."

For this game's development, I used the Unity engine as the game engine and C# as the programming language.

Since commercial engines like Unity and Unreal support C# for their internal operations source code, I had to choose C#.

However, I learned that various game engines can be used, and most mobile games or 2D games are developed using Unity.

Therefore, I decided to develop the game I wanted to create with Unity, as it is a simple 2D game.

During Development
During development, I referred to books for study and development. Since I was developing alone, I used free graphic models and audio sources (BGM) downloaded from websites.

Even though I referred to books, there were issues and difficulties encountered during development.

After Development
After the development was complete, I felt that the game was too simple, which was disappointing. This made me think about what more I could add.

Currently, there is only one game background, and I would like to diversify it. Also, I want to adjust the difficulty based on the background, adjusting the enemy's appearance speed or applying AI technology to make enemies come toward the user rather than just straight down.
