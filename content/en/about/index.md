      text: <br><span style="font-size:125%">My current interests are game development, artificial intelligence, VR content development, and quantum computing. My goal is to develop VR game content that provides users with a highly realistic experience, similar to the real world. To achieve this, I am interested in artificial intelligence technology that enables characters within the game to interact with users in realistic ways, as well as quantum computing technology that can meet the high-quality specifications required for developing such immersive games.</span>
